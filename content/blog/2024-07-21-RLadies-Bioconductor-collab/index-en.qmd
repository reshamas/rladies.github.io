We are excited to share a new collaboration between R-Ladies and Bioconductor, two global communities committed to building diverse developer communities around the world.

[R-Ladies](http://rladies.org) is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.
R-Ladies Global started in 2016 and has expanded to more than 200 chapters in 60+ countries worldwide.
R-Ladies chapters work alongside other like minded communities such as [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/en/), [RainbowR](https://rainbowr.netlify.app/), [miR](https://mircommunity.com/), [ArabR](https://arabr.github.io), [AfricaR](https://r4africa.org/), and [AsiaR](https://github.com/asiar-community).

[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) develops, supports, and disseminates free open-source software that facilitates rigorous and reproducible analysis of data from current and emerging biological assays.
The organization is dedicated to building a diverse, collaborative, and welcoming community of developers and data scientists.
To this end, they have periodically elected scientific, technical, and community advisory boards committed to the technical and community aspects of Bioconductor.

We are excited to begin a new initiative that aims to connect R-Ladies members who are also Bioconductor users or developers.
This effort is designed as a key step towards bringing together passionate individuals committed to expanding diversity in the computational biology and bioinformatics developer space.

Here are a few concrete ways in which we want to get the ball rolling:

-   Announce each others' events on websites or social media
-   Jointly host events about Bioinformatics with local R-Ladies Chapters interested in the topic. 
-   Promote R-Ladies local watch parties of live-casted or pre-recorded events and professional networking events for Bioconductor conferences (using content from BioC: BioC North America, BioCAsia, EuroBioC).
-   Highlight Bioconductor speakers at R + computational biology R-Ladies events across chapters

**Get Involved**

Excited to join us in this initiative?
Here's how you can get started:

-   Learn more about and partake in our joint initiative at the [Bioconductor Working Group page](https://workinggroups.bioconductor.org/currently-active-working-groups-committees.html#r-ladies-and-bioc).
-   Join our #rladies channel in [Bioconductor Slack](https://slack.bioconductor.org/) to stay updated and connect with the community.
-   Join the [R-Ladies Community Slack](https://guide.rladies.org/comm/slack/) to engage with the global community.

We recently kicked off this journey with local networking in R-Ladies chapters worldwide (e.g., [Aurora, Colorado](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-aurora/events/302185687/)) and an R-Ladies meetup in Michigan during BioC 2024, co-hosted with [R-Ladies East Lansing](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-east-lansing/events/302185529/) (Michigan)!

We\'re looking forward to building something great together.
Let us know what you think, share your ideas, or just say hi!
